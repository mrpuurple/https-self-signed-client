📋 Project Overview:
This project demonstrates how to create HTTPS clients in Python using the httpx library
to connect to sites with self-signed certificates, specifically targeting a local IoT 
device with CAP (Certificate Authentication Protocol) authentication.

🎯 Target Device:
• IP Address: 192.168.0.113
• Protocol: HTTPS with TLS 1.3
• Certificate: Self-signed (downloaded and analyzed)
• Authentication: Basic Auth (CAP) - configured via environment variables
• Device Type: IoT Interface
• API Endpoint: /api/v1/status (JSON response)

🔐 SSL/TLS Certificate Handling:
Two main approaches were implemented:

1. 🔓 Disable SSL Verification (Testing Only):
   • Use verify=False in httpx.Client()
   • Suitable for development and testing
   • ⚠️  Never use in production

2. 🔒 Custom Certificate Trust:
   • Download certificate using OpenSSL
   • Use verify="/path/to/cert.pem" in httpx.Client()
   • Secure approach for production use

📊 Device API Discovery:
The following endpoints were discovered and tested:

✅ Working Endpoints:
   • /api/v1/status (JSON) - Device status and connectivity info
   • /api/status (HTML) - Status page
   • /status (HTML) - Status page
   • /health (HTML) - Health check page  
   • /info (HTML) - Information page

❌ Non-existent Endpoints:
   • /api/v1/info (404)
   • /api/v1/health (404)
   • /api/v1/version (404)

🤖 IoT Device Information:
Based on API responses, the device is:
   • Interface Type: IoT
   • Serial Number: 37025231987
   • Current Status: idle
   • Server: nginx/1.20.1
   • Supported Protocols: MQTT, Kafka, Webhooks
   • Current Connectivity: All services disconnected

🛠️  Key Features Implemented:
   • ✅ Self-signed certificate handling
   • ✅ Basic authentication (CAP)
   • ✅ Certificate download and analysis
   • ✅ API endpoint discovery
   • ✅ JSON response parsing
   • ✅ Error handling and timeouts
   • ✅ Interactive device monitoring
   • ✅ SSL/TLS information extraction
   • ✅ Response header analysis

# Quick test without SSL verification:
python api_test.py

# Interactive device exploration:
python iot_client.py

# Download and trust certificate:
python cert_utility.py

# Complete SSL demonstration:
python complete_example.py

🔧 Code Examples:

1. Basic HTTPS Request:
```python
import httpx
import warnings

warnings.filterwarnings('ignore', message='Unverified HTTPS request')

with httpx.Client(verify=False) as client:
    response = client.get(
        "https://192.168.0.113/api/v1/status",
        auth=(os.getenv("DEVICE_USERNAME", "your_username"), 
              os.getenv("DEVICE_PASSWORD", "your_password"))
    )
    print(response.json())
```

2. Using Downloaded Certificate:
```python
import httpx

with httpx.Client(verify="192_168_0_113_cert.pem") as client:
    response = client.get(
        "https://192.168.0.113/api/v1/status",
        auth=(os.getenv("DEVICE_USERNAME", "your_username"), 
              os.getenv("DEVICE_PASSWORD", "your_password"))
    )
    print(response.json())
```

3. Certificate Information:
```python
import ssl
import socket

context = ssl.create_default_context()
context.check_hostname = False  
context.verify_mode = ssl.CERT_NONE

with socket.create_connection(("192.168.0.113", 443)) as sock:
    with context.wrap_socket(sock, server_hostname="192.168.0.113") as ssock:
        cert = ssock.getpeercert()
        print(f"SSL Version: {{ssock.version()}}")
        print(f"Cipher: {{ssock.cipher()}}")
```

🛡️  Security Considerations:
   • Always use verify=True in production environments
   • Store credentials securely (environment variables, key management)
   • Validate certificate chains properly
   • Use proper timeout values
   • Handle SSL errors gracefully
   • Monitor certificate expiration dates

📚 Dependencies:
   • httpx >= 0.24.0 - Modern HTTP client
   • ssl (built-in) - SSL/TLS support
   • socket (built-in) - Low-level networking
   • warnings (built-in) - Warning control
   • pathlib (built-in) - Path handling
